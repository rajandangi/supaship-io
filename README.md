# supaship.io (React + TypeScript + Vite)

## Quick start

Make sure docker is running, then:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rajandangi/supaship-io.git && \
  cd supaship.io && \
  npm && \
  npm add -D supabase && \
  npm debug
```

^ Installs the app and runs e2e tests in debug mode. (Good for a quick overview of all the app does).

## Local Dev

Install the supabase cli (this needs to be done manually to get the cli bin):

```bash
npm add -D supabase
```

Start supabase (make sure docker is running). This will run in background without taking a terminal, use `npx supabase stop` to end it.

```bash
npm supabase start --debug
```

Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To watch tailwind styles, run this in another terminal while developing:

```bash
 npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
```

## Prod Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy

Manual. Run build and then drop `/dist` into Netlify buccket
(Will automate later)

## e2e

Note: will drop all data from tables when you run it.

```bash
npm run test
```

To step through tests:

```bash
npm run debug
```

# üìù Notes

- `npx supabase migration new original-ddl` creates a migration file with the original DDL. This migration file can be used to recreate the database schema. DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a set of SQL commands that define the database structure.

- `npx supabase stop` stops the local instance of supabase server.

- `npx supabase start` starts the local instance of supabase server.

- __Supabase Auth UI__ is a pre-built UI component that allows you to easily add authentication to your application. It is built on top of Supabase's authentication API and provides a simple way to handle user sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery flows. You can customize the look and feel of the UI to match your application's design. https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-helpers/auth-ui

- Command to create a migration file from your current local Supabase state: 
  ```bash
  npx supabase db diff --use-migra --file=<name of the migration>
  ```

- Reset the database completely (will clear all data):
  ```bash
  npx supabase db reset
  ```
- Apply only pending migrations:
  ```bash
  npx supabase migration up
  ```

  ```bash
  npx supabase migration list
  ```
